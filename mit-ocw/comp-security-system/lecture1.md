Goal, cost of attacking your system outweighs the value of doing so. Why bother?

Cost of defense has more value that cost of value futhermore:

> Cost of attack > Cost of Value > Cost of defence

Things tend to be easier for the attacker, they only really need **one** method of compromise, that is essentially cheap to do.

## Example: School System (Blackboard)

A lot of cases and examples your're familiar with Please take better notes moving forward, Gil.
