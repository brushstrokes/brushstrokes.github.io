# OS and VM isolation

Operating systems and virtual machines have been the workhorses of isolation for a long time. One baseline isolation plan, which we don't have a reading assignment for, is to rely on the operating system to isolate processes / users / containers from one another; you have hopefully seen it in previous classes (such as 6.1800), and we will talk a bit about it in lecture. 

## Preparation

There are three readings associated with this lecture. Those being on gVisor, Firecracker, and the comparison of the two.
